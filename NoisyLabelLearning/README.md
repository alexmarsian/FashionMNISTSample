This is a tutorial on learning with noisy labels. I cover the theory behind the major types of label noise, and then apply 2 different methods using a version of the CIFAR data set with added label noise. The methods covered are transition matrix estimation by importance reweighting, and robust loss functions (3 different losses applied). 

Simply run the notebook in order, ensuring the .py files are available for import. You will need a GPU to train the models, although all output is printed if you just want to follow along.
