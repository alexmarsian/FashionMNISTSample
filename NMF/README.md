This is a sample project which explains the key concepts of non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF). A data set of real human faces is used to explore NMF. Different types of noise were also added to test NMF algorithms under a more realistic scenario (where images are slightly corrupted). 

Different NMF algorithms were selected for their purported robustness to noise. Currently the nmf notebook only implements two different NMF algorithms, however in future I would like to add others. The code has thus been structured in a way to easily add and analyse new NMF algorithms. 

References are provided throughout the notebook. Feel free to leave feedback and suggestions!
