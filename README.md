This repo has been shared with permission of the Course convenor for COMP5318 (Machine learning and data mining) at the University of Sydney. Reproducing code here for other assignments/courses at the University of Sydney will be considered plagiarism.

This work was completed with one other student. 

Constraints:

For this assignment, we were constrained to using simple machine learning methods to classify a subset of the fashion MNIST data set (still 10 classes with a reduced number of samples). 

Simple here meaning no GPU accelerated methods, and based on the first 6 weeks of the course: linear and logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods, and support vector machines (i.e. no deep learning methods). The task was to test at least three models and report the best.
