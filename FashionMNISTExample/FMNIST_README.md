# FashionMNISTSimple

This repo has been shared with permission of the Course convenor for COMP5318 (Machine learning and data mining) at the University of Sydney. Reproducing code here for other assignments/courses at the University of Sydney will be considered plagiarism.

This work was completed with one other student. 

Constraints:

For this assignment, we were constrained to using simple machine learning methods to classify a subset of the fashion MNIST data set (still 10 classes with a reduced number of samples). 

Simple here meaning no GPU accelerated methods, and based on the first 6 weeks of the course: linear and logistic regression, decision trees, ensemble methods, and support vector machines (i.e. no deep learning methods). The task was to test at least three models and report the best.

Languages/Libraries:

This project was completed using Python3 and the SciKit-Learn library.
